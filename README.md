# authentic-writer-chrome-extension

This is a chrome extension that helps you write authentic content.

It's based on a naive idea that if you remove backspace, copy and paste, you will be forced to write authentic content.

Is that true? I don't know.

## Limitations and Future Work

This is only scoped to work on substack.com domains for now. I plan on expanding it to other domains in the future or allowing it to be configurable by the user. Maybe. I may just forget this project and move on to something else.

## Trust me

I do not track any of your data. All I do capture is how many times you hit the backspace key, copy and paste. I don't send this data anywhere. If I do, I will let you know. I promise. Trust me.
